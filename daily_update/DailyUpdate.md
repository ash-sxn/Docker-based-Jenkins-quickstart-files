# Daily Update

### Date: 19/06/2023 MONDAY

As Jmm recommended adding some time for the job to complete for the user to see the progress, I thought maybe adding the sleep command for about 3-4 seconds before the actual command will let the user view it and won’t consume any extra resources either. I’ve asked Jmm on GitHub, let’s see what his reply is.

For Issue #25, I’ve created a separate branch named `bugfix/controller-restart` and created a PR with suitable changes that restarts the controller after restart or failure. I’ve added `restart: on-failure` to the Docker Compose file in the 02 example and also renamed the `+` in the 01 example to `plus` as Bruno mentioned in our one-to-one meeting.

Now, the two things remaining to work on right now are Issue #20 and doing something about the draft PR #27 created by Bruno.

Bervianto suggested adding the restart on failure option to the 01 example as well in Issue #25, and I added it.

Attended the weekly office hours with Bruno, Jmm, and Bervianto. Details of which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yij9OvM2_92My3vqjn6u8ABHjXcyy0a7O6oM30b6ctM/edit#).

I have new tasks which we have discussed during office hours which I am adding to the the Tasklist will help me complete all the tast from the meeting notes 

Task List:

- [ ] Propose a set of other examples to implement (Issue #20) (from previous task list).
- [ ] Work on PR #24 from mentor’s feedback (get PR #24 merged) (from previous task list).
- [ ] Complete PR #29 (Issue #25 - Restart on failure).
- [ ] Create an “epic” that lists all issues related to existing examples we should try to replicate.
- [ ] should create one issue per documentation part we’re trying to replicate.
- [ ] should focus on demo I’ll do on 6th of July, mostly about first persona.
- [ ] Create a document to prepare layout for presentation and share it with mentors so we can brainstorm asynchronously (think bullet points).
- [ ] Have a look as shm_size

### Date: 15/06/2023 THURSDAY
Okay, I slept a little too early yesterday and scheduled the doddle requested by bruno for the wrong time. I’ve messaged bruno that I am sorry and created the correct doodle, hopefully we should be able to have our one on one meeting today
On SeperateReadme PR, Jmm suggested to rename docker compose files from 00_docker-compose.yaml and 01_docker-compose.yaml to just docker-compose file, so we won’t need to use -f option in the command and it’s also not mentioned in the docs I provided in the PR. So the first task is to rename these files to docker-compose.yaml. Ok I’ve renamed the files and committed the changes with the conventional commit approach as bruno mentioned to use that in a issue he opened i.e. issue #17. Bruno also opened an issue #21 regarded this which I have linked to the PR and should auto close once the PR is merged 
On Dockerfile PR #14 now named “feature(example): Now builds a Docker image thanks to a local Dockerfile” by bruno (I should remember to name my PRs like this in future) and I am thinking to add a things to remember section in this daily update so that, I can read the important stuff easily, now other task is to add the credentials to the docs. OK I’ve added the credentials to the docs and made the commit with conventional commit approach, Jmm also mentioned to add the clean up instruction in the README files, since named volumes don’t go away with just docker compose down, which I forget to read and before and submitted PR for re-review(Remember to not do it agan) 
Bruno also opened some other issues:
First is to use the Conventional commit approach #17 I’ll paste the message from bruno here to remember is for future 
“The "Conventional Commits" approach suggests using specific prefixes in commit messages to convey the nature of the changes made. Here are the common prefixes used:
feat: Used for new features or enhancements.
fix: Used for bug fixes.
chore: Used for maintenance tasks, build processes or other non-user-facing changes.
docs: Used for documentation-related changes.
style: Used for code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation).
refactor: Used for code refactoring, without adding new features or fixing bugs.
test: Used for adding or modifying tests.
perf: Used for performance-related improvements.
build: Used for changes related to the build system or external dependencies.
ci: Used for changes to the continuous integration (CI) configuration or scripts.
Using these prefixes helps provide a clear and standardized way to categorize and understand the purpose of each commit.
It improves the readability and maintainability of commit history, making it easier for others (including your future self) to comprehend the changes made in the codebase. It's important to note that while the Conventional Commits approach is widely used and considered good practice, it's not mandatory. The key is to write descriptive and meaningful commit messages that accurately convey the purpose and impact of each commit.”

I asked Bruno for a convention in naming branches, and he replied with this:

Copy
When it comes to naming branches, there are a few conventions and best practices that can help make your branch names more descriptive and organized. It greatly varies depending on the project, and I’m not sure it’s clearly defined for the Jenkins project. Anyway, here are some common guidelines:

Use descriptive names: Choose branch names that clearly describe the purpose or goal of the branch. A well-named branch makes it easier for others (including your future self) to understand its purpose.
Use hyphens or underscores: Separate words in the branch name using hyphens (“-”) or underscores (“_”) to improve readability. For example, feature/new-feature or bugfix/issue-123.
Prefix with a category: Consider prefixing your branch names with a category or type to indicate the nature of the changes. Some commonly used prefixes include:
feature/: Used for new feature development.
bugfix/: Used for bug fixes.
hotfix/: Used for critical bug fixes in production.
refactor/: Used for refactoring code without adding new features or fixing bugs.
chore/: Used for maintenance tasks or non-user-facing changes.
docs/: Used for documentation-related changes.
test/: Used for adding or modifying tests.
Include a reference ID (optional): As we’re using GitHub’s issues, you may consider including an issue number in the branch name to associate it with a specific task or issue. For example, feature/issue-123.
Keep it concise: Aim for concise branch names that convey the necessary information without being too lengthy. Long branch names can be cumbersome to work with.
Here’s an example that combines these conventions:

feature/add-login-functionality
bugfix/fix-navigation-bug
refactor/restructure-database-schema
chore/update-dependencies
docs/update-readme
test/add-unit-tests
Remember, these conventions are not strict rules but rather guidelines to help maintain consistency and clarity within this project. I even can’t promise I will follow these rules every time.


The second issue is to create a working “One Job” example which Bruno opened in #18, which I’ll add to today’s work list.

The third issue Bruno opened is to get rid of the subdirectories for the daily journal, this is Issue #19. Which I’ll add to today’s work list too. For this, Bruno also said to copy all the content from old files to DailyUpdate.md file then get rid of the subdirectories. For this, I’ll create a new branch DailyUpdate in which I’ll do all the updates from now on and also delete the subdirectories because I was just pushing to the main branch until now to update the DailyUpdate.md file. Okay, I’ve created the branch and opened a PR linking the issue and deleted the subdirectories and updated DailyUpdate.md with their content.

The last issue created by Bruno is Issue #20. In which he suggests thinking about some examples I would like to see, especially considering newcomers to Jenkins. He also gave some suggestions:

- Demonstrating the use of LDAP to store credentials
- Illustrating the use of PostgreSQL to store credentials
- Exploring the use of Docker in Docker or Docker on Docker to build Docker images
- Showcasing the utilization of DinD or DonD to execute pipelines with existing Docker images

He suggests thinking of examples in order that increase in complexity while still being accessible and approachable for newcomers.
For the Job part, I have created a new branch to work on named `feature/adding-job` (following convention). I pasted all the hello example I tested before in the 02 example and committed the changes to the branch, and when I ran it on Gitpod, it again gave me the error from before. The only change I made was adding `USER JENKINS` at the end of the Dockerfile, so that must be the reason that’s causing the error. From which I concluded that the Jenkins user does not have write permission for the jobs folder anymore. Therefore, the solution must be to give it permissions with the root user, so I added `RUN chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/jenkins_home/jobs` under root user and it worked!


Now I have opened PR #24 Feature/adding job which closes issue #18. So, I am ticking issue #18 task and adding a new one which tells to work on PR #24 by the feedback provided by mentors, basically getting PR #24 merged.


Okay, now the only thing to work on is thinking of examples to implement until mentors give suggestions on job PR #24.
Bruno suggested to remove the build directory from the PR because it's not necessary and I have deleted it 

PR #23 that was for the cleanup doc for 02 example has been merged 

Jmm has suggested to add some waits(calculation to increase time to finish) so that user is able to see the process when it's happening in the UI,
since He/She doesn't know where to look being new users, I'll work on it tomorrow 
Bruno also suggested to read this [article](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/05/27/docker-image-new-lifecycle/) under the issue #25 and to remove the + from the name of the example since it's not compatible with all file system, on which I'll work tomorrow as well 


For today’s work include:


- [x] Complete the SeperateReadme PR, rename to `docker-compose.yaml`, solves Issue #21.
- [x] Added credentials to PR #14 and apologized for delay.
- [x] Add clean-up instructions in README files of examples. PR #24 and PR #16
- [x] Create a working "one job" example (Issue #18).
- [x] Get rid of subdirectories from daily journal (Issue #19).
- [ ] Propose a set of other examples to implement (Issue #20).(I'll add this for next day's task list )
- [ ] Work on PR #24 from mentor’s feedback (get PR #24 merged).(I'll add this for next day's task list)


Things to remember:


- Name your PRs like PR #14 as Bruno did so it’s easy for others to understand.
- Make your commits in the conventional commit approach so that it’s easy for others to understand like mentioned by Bruno in Issue #17.
- Make sure to name your branch according to convention.
- Not to submit PR for re-review before checking if there are multiple suggested changes.

### Date: 14/06/2023 WEDNESDAY

I’ve tried to transfer the jobs directory with Docker Compose instead of using the COPY command within the Dockerfile, and it worked fine without any errors. I used the the volume section of the docker compose file to do that.

Now I am testing if the error was happening because I was using the Jenkins user, so now I have changed the Jenkins user to root and am again doing it with the COPY command from the Dockerfile.

It worked!  
With the root user, so it was a permission issue, I guess. So, I guess I’ll ask my mentor if this job is fine and make a PR for it tomorrow.

Bruno suggested adding the credentials part of the 02 example to the README file, that is `admin`,`admin` for this example, and also for a one-to-one private meeting which we’ll have tomorrow.

- [x] The Persona PR #2 is merged.
- [x] The Gitpod Docs PR #15 is also merged.

Didn’t do much work today, will compensate for this tomorrow.



### Date: 13/06/2023 TUESDAY

I got a message from Bervianto that said to correct some typos and explain the setup in more detail, to make it easy for new people to the project to understand. Bruno did suggest the typos from the PR, from which I created the commits. But I created them separately, which I should have done in one single commit as Kris said to me before (remember not to do this again in the future).

I did make some more commits explaining the setup of Gitpod too and made a commit.

For Today’s Tasks, there are:

- [x] Complete the Persona PR. Bruno also mentioned it on GitHub today.
- [x] Create a separate README for each example.
- [x] Work on the Job part of the Jenkins setup.
- [x] Create special sub-directories Dockerfile as suggested by Jmm.
- [x] Store security-related stuff (e.g., the secret key) in its dedicated directory as suggested by Jmm.

First thing is to complete the Persona PR. I have added points in the Persona README to make things clear and also added a table as Bervianto suggested and committed to the PR with name ‘addingPointsAndTable’.

I also faced some issues while pushing things from Git from my terminal because I forgot to pull before adding a new commit, and I did make some changes to the file from GitHub itself. So, I had to use `git reset --soft HEAD~` command to solve the problem, which is a nice learning (try to remember that for future and not to add things directly from GitHub, and if you do, do `git pull` first).

Now for creating separate READMEs for each example. I created separate READMEs for every example, first for 02 and added it in the #14 PR since it was not merged yet. And created a separate branch named ‘SeperateREADME’ for creating files for 00 and 01 examples, created the README.md files, and opened the PR. Okay, so that task is done.

For the next task, that is to create special subdirectories and store security-related stuff in secrets as suggested by Jmm. Instead of creating separate PRs for 1st and 2nd points of Jmm’s suggestion, I've added it in adding Dockerfile PR. Before I thought this was bigger but they were really short work, that’s why.
 
I did work on the Job part too I created a simple job named hello copied it from the controller container to my local machine with command `cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target`  and it did work. But when I tried to place it inside the new image with docker image with `COPY` command and ran the container it gave this error before even starting the instance

I'll look why did this error happen tomorrow and work more on the job part and work on the feedback from mentors from the submitted PRs

### DATE: 12/06/2023 MONDAY

As Jmm suggested, from today I'll keep a daily update/journal in a single file. First of all, today is June 12th, but it will be the 13th by the time I upload this since I am working late. Today I attended the weekly office hour and had a personal chat with Jmm as an org admin.

For the first piece of work today, I am solving issue #13 opened by Bervianto in which I need to add guidelines for using Gitpod for outside users. Bervianto suggested covering these topics:
- [x] How to set up the repo in Gitpod?
- [x] Steps to run example 01
- [x] How to verify Jenkins was installed?

These are the essential things so that people outside the project can interact or understand the project, but I can add other things as well if I want. For this, I am creating a separate branch named "GitpodDocs". I have created a section for the 'How to set up repo in Gitpod' part. Now for 'Steps to run example 01'. Okay, I did create things for the second part i.e. 'Steps to run example 01', now for the third part. Okay, the third part is complete and I am making a PR from the branch `GitPodDocs` which solves issue #13 (remember not to use the wrong keyword again). I've corrected some grammatical mistakes from the doc and pushed the changes and created a PR and Bruno has already seen it.

Now for the next task is to incorporate the feedback given by the mentors on PR #14 that I created to add a custom Dockerfile.
- [x] The first suggestion is from Bervianto to set back the user to Jenkins as mentioned [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#installing-more-tools) as a good practice. I'll remember that. Thanks @bervianto.
- [x] The second suggestion is also from Bervianto in which he tells me to disable the built-in agent through a property in JCasC file which will ensure that the agent is used to run the job. Thanks again @bervianto as this was the issue I was facing when running the job today. Jmm also says it's a very important practice.
- [x] The third suggestion is also from Bervianto to remove unused plugins from the plugin.txt file as they just waste resources right now.
- [ ] The fourth suggestion is from Jmm, actually Jmm gave 5 suggestions in a big paragraph which are:
    - [ ] Store all material required to build the custom Docker image in a special sub-directory (ex ./images/controller/ or ./dockerfiles/ or ./dockerfiles/controller/). Which I don't clearly understand by the example, I'll ask about it on the Gitter Channel.
    - [ ] Store security-related stuff (ex secret key) in its dedicated directory (I use ./secrets/).
    - [ ] Subject to discussion: importing JCasC configuration into image (Dockerfile) makes it very static (which can make sense). The alternative way would be to map a local directory (containing config files) into an adequate place in Jenkins filesystem. It will make it very easy to adapt configuration.
    - [ ] We need to discuss rational and implication for mounting named volume. The advantage is that (manual) modifications to configuration are persistent. But is this something we want to have? To restart system, it requires removing named volume (a docker-compose down is not sufficient).
    - [ ] I have a feeling that adding small note (aka readme.me) in each experiment would help people like me a lot. You could start by saying what demo does (or supposed to do), how to start it, how to tear it down.
- [x] Last suggestion for today is from Bervianto to use pinned version of each plugin in plugin.txt file. Bruno also agrees and says then we can use Dependabot later on.

Okay, I've done everything from Bervianto's suggestions and now that I read Jmm's suggestion again and got what he meant by first suggestion. I'll make PR for that tomorrow.
